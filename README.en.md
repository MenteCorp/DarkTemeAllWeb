# Disclaimers and warnings

## Disclaimer

- Even if you or a third party suffers any damage or loss due to the use of this project, the application of CSS, or the download, installation, use, or analysis of the extensions or any other extensions introduced here, you do so on the premise of your own judgment and responsibility, and you agree to indemnify and hold MENTE and all project-related parties harmless. MENTE and all parties involved in the project will not be held liable for any damages or losses.  

## Project start date

The project started in April 2021.

## Warning about possible loss etc.

- Applying the dark theme CSS will cause popups and website expressions to not display properly. For example, if you get some kind of sale or coupon, it might not look like it is displayed on the website.  
- The extensions mentioned can override CSS as of June 1, 2021, but they will only do this to the CSS that is downloaded to your browser and will not cause any damage to the website.  


## Extensions Warning

- In order to use this project properly, you need to have the skills to analyze the extensions and make sure there are no problems. If you do not have such skills, you are defined here as a beginner.
- To use an extension properly, a novice needs to search for an appropriately rated extension on an appropriate extension download site, and then download and install it.
- Do not enter your ID or Password on the browser where the extension is installed, especially if you are using a browser with an extension that requires permissions. Depending on the permissions required by the extension, the extension may or may not be malicious and can retrieve the string you enter. This is a major risk of information loss, especially for beginners, so be sure to avoid this risk.
- To avoid this risk, it is recommended to operate with rules such as not entering personal information on the browser where the extension is installed, and also to use a browser that is specially designed to protect personal information. In addition, we strongly recommend that you use a browser specifically designed to protect personal information, or take as many measures as possible, such as installing a browser specifically designed to install extensions.
- Registration of an account may be required to use some extensions.
- Some extensions may display advertisements when you use them.

## Project Management Warning
- This project is designated to be updated periodically, but may stop updating without notice.
- When a site supports dark themes, the previously supported CSS files will be stored in the old folder for posterity. In addition, the issues of the supported site will be closed.
